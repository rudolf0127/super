     *         or partially, with an arbitrary number of items for offer and
     *         consideration per order alongside criteria resolvers containing
     *         specific token identifiers and associated proofs. Any order that
     *         is not currently active, has already been fully filled, or has
     *         been cancelled will be omitted. Remaining offer and consideration
     *         items will then be aggregated where possible as indicated by the
     *         supplied offer and consideration component arrays and aggregated
     *         items will be transferred to the fulfiller or to each intended
     *         recipient, respectively. Note that a failing item transfer or an
     *         issue with order formatting will cause the entire batch to fail.

     *                                  fill. Note that both the offerer and the
     *                                  fulfiller must first approve this
     *                                  contract (or their proxy if indicated by
     *                                  the order) to transfer any relevant
     *                                  tokens on their behalf and that

     *                                  ERC1155 tokens as consideration. Also
     *                                  note that all offer and consideration
     *                                  components must have no remainder after
     *                                  multiplication of the respective amount
     *                                  with the supplied fraction for an
     *                                  order's partial fill amount to be
     *                                  considered valid.
     * @param criteriaResolvers         An array where each element contains a

     *                                  consideration, a token identifier, and a
     *                                  proof that the supplied token identifier
     *                                  is contained in the merkle root held by
     *                                  the item in question's criteria element.
     *                                  Note that an empty criteria indicates
     *                                  that any (transferrable) token
